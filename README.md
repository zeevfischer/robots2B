## Project Overview
This project focuses on real-time ArUco marker detection and pose estimation using a camera feed. It processes live video input to detect ArUco markers, calculate their 3D pose, and provide movement commands to align the camera with a reference image.

## Features
- Real-time ArUco marker detection
- 3D pose estimation (distance, yaw, pitch, roll)
- Movement command generation for camera alignment
- Live video processing and display
- Data logging to CSV files
- Frame-by-frame analysis and visualization

## Requirements
- Process each frame in real-time (under 30 ms).
- Use Tello's camera parameters: 720p resolution, 82.6 FoV
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2) with ArUco module
- NumPy
- Pandas

## How To Run
1. Basic understanding of running code is required.
2. Ensure all necessary libraries are installed. If you encounter issues with cv2, use pip install opencv-contrib-python.
3. Use PyCharm or any other Python IDE to open the workspace.
4. Download the repository and place final.py and the data and output directories into your Python workspace.
5. Ensure all files are in the same workspace, or update the paths in the code to match your directory structure

## Key Functions
- `calculate_3d_info`: Calculates distance, yaw, pitch, and roll from pose vectors.
- `process_live_frame`: Processes each frame from the live feed, detecting markers and calculating poses.
- `calculate_movement_commands`: Generates movement commands based on current and reference poses.
- `draw_directions`: Visualizes movement commands on the frame.
- `display_live_stream`: Main function for capturing and processing the live video feed.

## Output
- Live video display with detected ArUco markers and pose information
- CSV file (`output_data_live.csv`) with frame-by-frame detection data
- Saved frames with detected markers in the `output/frames/` directory

## Notes
- The code uses camera parameters for a 720p resolution and 82.6Â° Field of View.
- Adjust the camera index in `cv2.VideoCapture(1)` if necessary.
- The reference information is read from `data/output_data_video.csv`.
